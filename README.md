# iCloset

This is a project that will allow you to view the items in your closet digitally! You can mix and match your clothing pieces to create outfits with the click of a button using the Outfit Maker feature. To get started, just add the image and details about your clothing piece to make it appear in My Closet!

## Setup

1. Run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies from the `package.json` file:
```sh
npm install
```

2. Run json-server in your terminal from a directory that has a db.json file present.
```sh
npm run server
```

3. Once your server is up and running to allow use of the application, type the command below into your terminal to open the file on your browser.
```sh
npm start
```
